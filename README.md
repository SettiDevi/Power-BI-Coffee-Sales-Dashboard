The Dashboard called Coffee Sales Dahboard was created  for providing the detailed insights on these 3 tasks.

KPI's performed:

1.Total Sales

2.Total Revenue

1.Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis:In this task I find Hourly Coffee sales of each day from March to August month.
Key Findings- The peak time sales are happened at 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the Morning and Evening at 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.So at that time the coffee sales are high if one more vending machine are available at that time the sales are raised gradually.To get more revenue and to expand Coffee business we have to provide one more vending machine in the store.   

2.Next day/week/month sales:In this task I Forecast next 60 days sales to get an understanding whether the sales are increased or not by using previous 6 months data.

3.Specific customer purchases: In this task customer specific purchases insights are created.From these we can find out who are buying coffee regularly and which coffee they are buying.
